How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Viewing the differences between the two version allowed me to see what has changed and see if those changes might have affected the latter version to have errors.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Seeing the changes will allow one to find errors and changes to help him figure out where to go next or what to fix now.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

By doing manual commit, one has the ability to commit after a SINGLE logical change rather than intervals that may not have any logical changes or after several changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is designed for programmers etc that will often require committing multiple files at once whereas people using Google Docs etc do not need that function.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log will show a history of the commits with their ids and then use git diff with older and newer id to get a comparison with the differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Version control allows me to go back to an older version if I were to have broken the current version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Help learn programming etc while utilizing version control
