When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on a calloborative project, want to back up work, and, probably, many more reasons.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manually pulling changes allow the user to have far more greater control than automatically staying up to date. It allows the user to pull the changes they want instead of all changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a remote copy of a respository. Clone copies a remote or local to local. Branches are seperate routes that are built not part of the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

With a locally stored state, the user can decide whether or not to merge the branch with the one on gitHub or
create a new branch instead.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

You do everything offline with multiple files and backups of your files that need to be distributed to all collaborators
and whoever else needs to access and/or edit the files. Git and GitHub are significantly easier.
